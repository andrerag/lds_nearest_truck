LoadSmart Take Home Test
<br><br>
Problem:<br>
Given a list of trucks and their current locations and a list of cargos and their pickup and delivery
destinations, find the optimal mapping of trucks to cargos to minimize the overall distances all trucks
must travel.<br>
<br>
Assume:<br>
• Each truck can only carry up to one cargo and each truck can only make up to one trip.<br>
• Variable of calculating the cost of return trip for the truck back to its original start point is not<br>
needed.<br>
• Distance should be calculated using geographical distance - not using roads.<br>
<br>
When finished:<br>
● Please email the ZIP solution to task@loadsmart.com Please do not submit the file via
downloadable link.<br>
● Please label the email subject line (Your Full Name - Loadsmart Take Home Test)<br>
● Please keep in mind that we may ask you to improve and/or change your solution during the
interview.<br>
● Please include a readme file which explains your solution in about 5-8 lines.<br>
<br>
FAQs:<br>
• Can the implementation contain external dependencies? i.e: services, road data, graph library – No<br>
• You cannot work on this with anyone else<br>
• This will count as a majority of your interview so please know gravity of this assignment.<br>
• Loadsmart will reach out to you directly once reviewed<br>
• You will get less points for using a library (standard libraries are fine)<br>
• You will get less points for using Euclidian geometry<br>
• File - trucks.csv: List of trucks and their home city<br>
• File - cargo.csv: List of cargo we need to move (with product name, origin and destination city)<br>
• Please do not manipulate the data set in the CSV file.<br>
• Please send one single solution which best solves the problem.<br>
